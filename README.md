# ReadingSpeedTest
iOS application designed to read a file and display the contents word by word based on words per minute dictated by user.
Uses a tab bar view controller in combination with a navigation controller to create a multi-view iOS applicaiton.
The program allows for multiple users to be registered in order to store reading attempts. The application will also display
a list of users and their top reading score in a list view. The application uses an archiver to save previous information 
between sessions so even if the application is closed, previous attempts will still be loaded back into application.
